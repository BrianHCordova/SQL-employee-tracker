## Your Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. This assignment builds a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

## Installation 
Download or clone the repo to your local machine. Because this application will require the use of the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your projects integrated terminals folder: `npm i.` The user then must then lauch Postgres by running by running the command: `psql -U postgres` in the integrated terminal, then entering `password` for the password prompt. Continue to the terminal and run the command: `\i db/schema.sql` and then the command `\i db/seeds.sql` to initalize and see the database. Run the command `\q` to exit Postgres. Finally, the user runs the command: `node index.js` to launch the application.
* Note: `postgres` and `password` are subject to the users own User and Password linked to their postgres.
